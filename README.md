# Pharmacy_counting

The work asks to generate a list of all drugs, print out the drugs information in new way, which listed in descending order based on the total drug cost, and count the number of prescribers who prescribed the drug with the drug name.

The code challenge is written by python, Firstly, read data from input folder, get the drugs information. And then, map the information to new dict, process raw data, calculate each drug's num of prescribers and total cost, and caluclate total_cost and increment num_prescriber if drug_name is in drug_list already. Finally, write data into output file.

The code also works in the test file, and get the correct results.
